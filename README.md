# RomanNumerals

This repository contains code for the Roman Numeral conversion exercise. 

## The Brief
We would like you to create a Roman Numerals Converter Console Application using the Java programming language.
To create your console application, we would like you to create a Maven project (using IntelliJ) and 
push your repository to GitHub.

## Instructions
Run the com.techreturners.romannumerals.RomanNumeralsConverterConsole java class to 
start the application and follow the on screen instructions. 

## Features 
The application can convert up to largest Roman numeral possible which is 3999. 

## Limitations
This method does not check for valid combinations of the letters
* such as if a letter is repeated more than 3 times or
* that the letters V,L,D are not repeated
